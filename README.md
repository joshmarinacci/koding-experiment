# Future of Koding: Mark 1

This demonstrates adding unit tests to a simple function definition.
Every time you edit it will run the unit tests and let you know
if something breaks.  The unit tests are stored as part of the
code base but are not run when executing from the command line,
so there is no overhead to setting up and maintaining unit tests.
The tests are always there and always run, entirely managed by the system.
